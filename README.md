# S.H.I.F.T.
Shift is NASA's lightweight framework for high performance local and remote file transfers that provides resiliency across a wide variety of failure scenarios through various techniques. These include end-to-end integrity via cryptographic hashes, throttling of transfers to prevent resource exhaustion, balancing transfers across resources based on load and availability, and parallelization of transfers across multiple source and destination hosts for increased redundancy and performance.
# shiftJS
ShiftJs will be a port of S.H.I.F.T. from perl to js
